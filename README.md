# 📝 PyVi, a Vi-like text editor written in Python!

PyVi is designed to be very easy to use for Vi/Vim/NeoVim users, as the commands are very similar.
Speaking of, the commands PyVi currently supports are:

 - :i, Insert text
 - :a, Append text
 - :c, Clear line
 - :w, Write file
 - :o, Open file
 - :q, Quit

## Getting started
After downloading PyVi, and creating a new file, use `:i 0 Some Text` to insert text at line 0
